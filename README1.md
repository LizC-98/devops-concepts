## Software Delivery Life Cycle:
Software development life cycle can be described as the process of building a software application. It can be divided into 8 steps, these are planning, requirements, designing, building, documenting, testing, deploying, and maintaining.
These are the steps that are recommended for software development to go through. It can be seen as a way to improve and measure the process of application development by allowing the developer to break down steps of the app cycle. By doing so, this can maximize efficiency, reduce costs, deliver content faster and satisfy their customers. 

## Test Driven Development:
Test driven development is a software development process that can be described as the repetition of short lines of code to ensure it works properly. This allows developers to keep testing the code to ensure the content delivery meets its expectations. It is the repetition of code testing to avoid issues such as bugs and conflicts. 

## Continuous Integration:
Continuous integration can be described as a development process where developers would continuously integrate code into a shared repository space and can range from uploading code several times a day. An example of this would be a group uploading code to a shared repository on Github. After the code is uploaded, it is then tested and verified by an automated build to detect errors and conflicts.This allows a team that is working on various parts of the code to merge their code to have less conflict issues. 

## Continuous Delivery: 
Continuous delivery can be described as the ability to deliver content to the users safely, efficiently and quickly.These continuous delivery methods include new updates, new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and new experimental ideas. This is the stage where developers continuously work on the application to ensure it is always in its deployable state and ready to send to users. Many benefits of this method include higher quality apps, lower costs, better products, faster marketing and many more. 

## Configuration Management:
Configuration management is the process of establishing and maintaining the consistancy of a product's performance.This process maintains the computer systems, servers, and software in a constant stable desired state. This is the maintenance stage of an applications development cycle. By managing the systems, developers can ensure that the application or software stays up to date and is managed for various situations. 

## Containerization:
Containerization allows applications to run in a virtual container environment. In this process, applications are run through isolated user spaces known as containers which use the same shared operating system. The container is a fully packaged portable computing environment in which developers can use to their advantage. This can be helpful because there may be some things that a developers computer cannot handle that the container can. An example would be a virtual machine or services from AWS. 

## Cloud Scalability, and Reliability:
Cloud scalability can be described as the ability to increase or decrease the power or size of an IT solution. This is the reasoning behind why many cloud computing services run so fast due to the fact that the developers scaled the application to work that way. It allows developers to adjust their applications and scale it to how they want without the worry of capacity needs. Cloud reliability can be described as providing highly available and reliable resources in cloud computing. This can result in maintaining customer confidence while preventing economic losses.
